# ChatPy
A Simple replacement for ChatGPT 

If you have access to OpenAI API, you can use ChatPy to chat with GPT4 instead of buying ChatGPT Plus. The API has Pay As You Go payment model, so it is much cheaper than ChatGPT Plus if you only want to use it for personal stuff. Keep in mind though, you won't get access to other features like Code Interpreter, Plugins, etc.

## How to run

Get your APIs from [SerpAPI](https://serpapi.com/users/sign_up) and [OpenAI](https://openai.com/product) and paste the API keys in chat.py file

After this simply run chat.py using `python3 chat.py`
